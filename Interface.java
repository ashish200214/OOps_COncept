/* 
  Interface :- Interface is fully un-implemented class used for declaring the set of operation of an object for developing a loosely coupled runtime polymorphic object user class to use these opeation from different subclasses of this interface.
               It is purely abstract class allows us to define only "public static final variables" and "public abstract methods" for declaring a object operations.
               It is basically contract between service provider and service user , service provider proides service to the service user.
               It is introduced to achieve multiple inheritance in java.
